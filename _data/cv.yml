    - title: Develop a spectroscopic method to determine the standard adsorption enthalpy of CO on Cu electrode
      institution: Department of Physical Chemistry, CCME, Peking University
      year: 2021/07 - 2022/09
      description:
        - Designed and constructed a special cell to determine the temperature dependence of CO adsorption. Developed several ATR-SEIRAS to characterize CO adsorption enthalpy on Cu electrode and estimate the absolute CO coverage.
        - Determined the standard adsorption enthalpy of CO on Cu surfaces at electrochemical interface for the first time. Further, high-pressure SEIRAS were employed to estimate the absolute CO coverage on Cu, which led to the determination of the standard adsorption Gibbs free energy and entropy of CO.
        - Correlated the CORR activity with the absorption strength on Cu to indicate that the presence of stronger CO binding sites on OD Cu could favor C2+ products, which experimentally proved that CO binding energy is a key descriptor of CORR catalysts.

    - title: Use gas-diffusion type microfluidic electrolyzer to benchmark commercial Cu catalysts in CO2RR
      institution: Department of Physical Chemistry, CCME, Peking University
      year: 2022/10 - 2023/03
      description:
        - Used gas-diffusion type microfluidic electrolyzer to evaluate CO2RR performance of commercial Cu catalysts. Results suggested that commercial Cu catalysts can achieve similar or better performances compare to many reported designed Cu-based catalysts.
        - Demonstrated that the catalyst loading could effectively impact the product distribution by altering the electrode potential, and showed that high CORR performance could be achieved with enhanced selectivity of acetate due to the higher local alkalinity at reaction interface.
        - Our results highlighted the excellent intrinsic activity and selectivity of commercial Cu catalysts in CO2RR, and suggested that future catalyst design should focus more on improving selectivity and reducing overpotential. 


    - title: Investigate effective urea synthesis through electrocatalytic oxidative C-N bond formation 
      institution: Department of Physical Chemistry, CCME, Peking University
      year: 2022/12 - 2023/06
      description:
      - Reported a novel electrocatalytic oxidative coupling strategy for urea synthesis for the first time. Demonstrated the catalytic performance with high formation rate and FE surpassing all reported synthesis via electrochemical coupling through quantitative evaluation.
      - Proposed the mechanism through combined electrochemical, in-situ spectroscopic, and computational investigations.
      - Provided a new route in urea formation with high electron efficiency and low energy consumption compared to the current industrial process undergoing co-reduction of CO2 and nitrate.
